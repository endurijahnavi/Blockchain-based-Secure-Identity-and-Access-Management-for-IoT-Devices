# Blockchain-based Secure Identity and Access Management for IoT Devices ü§ñüîí

## Executive Summary üìù

This project proposes a groundbreaking blockchain-based solution aimed at revolutionizing identity verification and access control for IoT (Internet of Things) devices. In an era where data privacy, IoT device security, and personal identity management pose significant challenges, our solution provides a secure, transparent, and user-centric approach. By addressing the vulnerabilities inherent in current systems, we pave the way for enhanced data security and privacy in the digital age.

1. Device Registration and Verification:
   - Manufacturers or device owners register IoT devices on the blockchain using a unique device ID.
   - Any entity can verify the registered device through its unique device ID, accessing information such as current and past owners, and stolen status.

2. Ownership Transfer:
   - Device owners can securely transfer ownership of IoT devices through the blockchain.
   - Immutable records of ownership transfer ensure transparency and prevent unauthorized ownership changes.

3. Stolen Device Reporting:
   - In case of theft, device owners can update the stolen status of the device on the blockchain.
   - Any entity verifying the device will be notified of its stolen status, enhancing the security of the IoT ecosystem.
